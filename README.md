## Usage
Upon entering the application, your balance will be set at $0. You will see two fields for you to insert information; one for a transaction name and the other for transaction amount. As you enter your data you will notice a few things:
Your total balance on top of the page in bold text. 
All your transaction history with the name and amount side by side.
And just below that will be a chart of your balance to better help you visualize your expenses.
